# Gemini CLI Test Project: Voice Discussion Assistant PoC

This repository is for a test project using the Gemini CLI agent.

## Objective

The goal is to test the capabilities of the Gemini agent by building a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a voice-based discussion assistant application.

We are starting from a state where the initial requirements have been discussed and the development tasks have been created as GitHub Issues. The test is to see how the development progresses and what the outcome will be when we proceed without setting strict, detailed constraints on the implementation from the beginning.
